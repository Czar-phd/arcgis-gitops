# ArcGIS Automation using GitHub Actions

The template repository provides [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflows that automate deployment and operation of [ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com) following Infrastructure as Code methodologies, foundational system patterns, and best practices recommended for enterprise IT systems.

## Features

For the supported ArcGIS Enterprise deployment options the workflows provide:

* Automation of initial deployment, updates, upgrades, and disaster recovery operations
* Built-in observability and monitoring subsystems
* Integration with existing network and security infrastructure
* Machine image building subsystems
* Standardized approach to security assessments and authorizations
* Tracking and managing changes to both application and infrastructure configurations
* Transparent and modular design that is easy to understand, customize, or extend
* Version control of infrastructure and application configurations

The workflows leverage popular DevOps tools, including Terraform, Ansible, and Packer, to automate provisioning infrastructure and application configuration management.

## Instructions

The workflows designed to be used together to achieve a specific goal are grouped into *templates*.

See the walkthroughs in the wiki pages for detailed instructions on how to use the templates:

* The [Getting Started walkthrough](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-gitops/wiki/Getting-Started) will guide you through the process of deploying, disaster recovery, and patching of a highly available ArcGIS Server site in Amazon Web Services public cloud using GitHub Actions.
* The [ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes in AKS walkthrough](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-gitops/wiki/ArcGIS-Enterprise-on-Kubernetes-in-AKS) will guide you through the process of deploying ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using GitHub Actions.

Refer to the READMEs of the cloud platform templates for specific usage instructions:

* [Templates for ArcGIS Enterprise on AWS](aws/README.md)
* [Templates for ArcGIS Enterprise on Microsoft Azure](azure/README.md)
