## Features

For the supported cloud providers and ArcGIS applications the workflows provide:

* Version control of infrastructure and application configurations

* Standardized approach to security assessments and authorizations
* Tracking and managing changes to both application and infrastructure configurations
* Transparent and modular design that is easy to understand, customize, or extend
* Machine image building subsystems
* Built-in observability and monitoring subsystems

The workflows designed to be used together to achieve a specific goal are grouped into *templates*. The templates are organized by cloud provider and ArcGIS application.
