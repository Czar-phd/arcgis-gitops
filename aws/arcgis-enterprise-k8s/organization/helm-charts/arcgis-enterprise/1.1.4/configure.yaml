  # FOLDER PATHS

  # Root folder paths for data stores. Registering folder paths during site creation
  # allows you to avoid disruptions that typically occur when registering folder
  # paths after the organization has been configured.
  #
  # Add any custom folder paths you wish to register below. For example:
  #
  # NOTE: REGISTERED_FOLDER_PATHS="/folder/path1,/folder/path2, etc..." is a
  # legacy variable. This variable is no longer recommended for use.

  # STORAGE PROPERTIES
  # ------------------------------------
  #
  # Storage type can be "STATIC" or "DYNAMIC". By default, the type is set to
  # DYNAMIC.
  #
  #  - For dynamic:
  #     - Storage class names are mandatory and must already exist in the cluster.
  #     - Labels are optional
  #  - For static:
  #     - Labels are mandatory.
  #     - Persistent Volume Claims use label selectors (matchLabels).
  #     - Persistent Volumes must match the label selector to be bound to the claim.
  #
  # - Size and type are mandatory for both static and dynamic storage.
  # - Values are case sensitive.
  # - For storage labels, use "key:value" syntax. For example:
  #
  #     label1: arcgis/tier:storage
  #     label2: arcgis/app:postgres
