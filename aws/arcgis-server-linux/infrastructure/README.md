# Infrastructure Terraform Module for ArcGIS Server on Linux

The Terraform module provisions AWS resources for highly available ArcGIS Server deployment on Linux platform.

![Infrastructure for ArcGIS Server on Linux](arcgis-server-linux-infrastructure.png "Infrastructure for ArcGIS Server on Linux")  

The module launches two SSM managed EC2 instances in the private VPC subnets or subnets specified by subnet_ids input variable.
The instances are launched from image retrieved from '/arcgis/${var.site_id}/images/${var.deployment_id}/{instance role}' SSM parameter.
The image must be created by the Packer Template for ArcGIS Server on Linux AMI.

For the primary EC2 instances the module creates "A" record in the VPC Route53 private hosted zone to make the instance addressable using permanent DNS names.

> Note that the EC2 instance will be terminated and recreated if the infrastructure terraform module is applied again after the SSM parameter value was modified by a new image build.

A highly available EFS file system is created and mounted to the EC2 instances.

The module creates an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with listeners for ports 80, 443, and 6443 and target groups for the listeners that target the EC2 instances.
Internet-facing load balancer is configured to use two of the public VPC subnets, while internal load balancer uses the private subnets.

By default the HTTPS listener on port 443 is forwarded to instance port 6443. Set the instance_https_port input variable to 443, if ArcGIS Web Adaptor on port 443 will be used with ArcGIS Server.

The deployment's Monitoring Subsystem consists of:

* An SNS topic and a CloudWatch alarms that monitor the target groups and post to the SNS topic if the number of unhealthy instances in nonzero.
* A CloudWatch log group
* CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instances that sends the system logs to the log group as well as metrics fo resource utilization on the EC2 instances.
* A CloudWatch dashboard that displays the CloudWatch alerts, metrics, and logs of the deployment.

All the created AWS resources are tagged with ArcGISSiteId and ArcGISDeploymentId tags.

## Requirements

On the machine where Terraform is executed:

* Python 3.8 or later with [AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) package must be installed.
* Path to aws/scripts directory must be added to PYTHONPATH.
* AWS credentials must be configured.

Before creating the infrastructure, an SSL certificate for the ArcGIS Server deployment FQDN
must be imported into or issued by AWS Certificate Manager service in the AWS account. The certificate's
ARN specified by "ssl_certificate_arn" input variable will be used to configure HTTPS listeners of the load balancer.

If deployment_fqdn and hosted_zone_id input variables are specified,
the module creates CNAME records in the hosted zone that routes the deployment FQDN to the load balancer DNS name.
Otherwise, after creating the infrastructure, the domain name must be pointed to the DNS name of Application Load Balancer
exported by "alb_dns_name" output value of the module.

> Note that a hosted zone can contain only one record for each domain name. Use different hosted zones for multiple deployments
  with the same deployment_fqdn, or configure the DNS records outside of the module.

## Troubleshooting

Use Session Manager connection in AWS Console for SSH access to the EC2 instances.

The SSM commands output stored in the logs S3 bucket is copied in the Terraform stdout.

## SSM Parameters

The module uses the following SSM parameters:

| SSM parameter name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| /arcgis/${var.site_id}/iam/instance-profile-name | IAM instance profile name |
| /arcgis/${var.site_id}/images/${var.deployment_id}/primary | Primary EC2 instance AMI Id |
| /arcgis/${var.site_id}/images/${var.deployment_id}/node | Node EC2 instances AMI Id |
| /arcgis/${var.site_id}/s3/logs | S3 bucket for SSM commands output |
| /arcgis/${var.site_id}/vpc/subnets | Ids of VPC subnets |
| /arcgis/${var.site_id}/vpc/hosted-zone-id | VPC hosted zone Id |
| /arcgis/${var.site_id}/vpc/id | VPC Id |
