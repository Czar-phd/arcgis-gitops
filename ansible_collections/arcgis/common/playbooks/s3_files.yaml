# This playbook creates directory for local repository.
# In the directory it creates a manifest file from the provided template,
# replacing the S3 bucket name, region, and local repository path with the
# provided values. Then it uses arcgis.common.s3files module to download
# setups and patches from the S3 bucket to the local repository.
